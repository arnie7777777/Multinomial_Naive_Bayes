The addition of 1 in the numerator ensures that there are no zero probabilities, as it adds a count of 1 to each feature for each class. The inclusion of n_features in the denominator is also part of the Laplace smoothing technique, as it ensures that the sum of the probabilities in each class adds up to 1.
